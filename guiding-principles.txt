1) Escape the tyranny of *order*

While relying on order provides to distinguish parameters
provides for concise syntax, it's also often arbitrary- there may
be no natural ordering of arguments. For the sake of
comprehension, specifying arguments explicitly is also clearer,
particularly when many arguments are involved.

2) Code must be pleasing to read! Pleasing code is:
    - Succinct
    - Typographically optimized for humans!

3) Typed code is better code.

4) Human time is more important than machine time. 

5) Everything is a hashmap or an atom

6) Simple is better than complex!
