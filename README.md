# Tali 

Tali is a hashmap-y Lisp!

## Motivation

### *Another* Lisp, huh?

Yeah! Why not? Tali is designed to explore an extreme end of the
design space: hashmaps for everything, keywords everywhere! 

Will the result be more readable? Incomprehensible?? Let's find
out!

### Did you name this after a Mass Effect character? 

If it piques your interests, sure! If you're a lawyer, definitely
not!

Really, I just think Tali's a great name for a programming
language - fun, short, and homonymically rooted in computing!
